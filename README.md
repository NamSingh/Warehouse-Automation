# Warehouse-Automation
Train a robot navigate a storage warehouse, avoid obstacles, and deliver packages. Using Reinforcement Learning.

This reinforcement learning model relies on the Gymnasium Frozen Lake Environment. Please install the following dependencies:
- gym
- gym-notices
- gymnasium
- ipywidgets
- pickle
- pygames
- tqdm


### Running the Code:
The code has been provided in both an ipynb format and a python file format. Two format formats have been provided, so you may run whichever format you prefer. The only difference, is that the `.py` format will show a frame by frame emulation, of the final run.

The code will first run through an example with Q-Learning, and then runs through an example with SARSA.
By default, it uses the same set of hyper-parameters for both RL Agents.

To run locally, please perform the following steps: (ctrl+f to find the task in the code)
- [ ] Task 1: Update image folder location
- [ ] Task 2: Update the hyperparameters

Q-Learning:
- [ ] Task 4: (optional) Update the custom map:

SARSA:
- [ ] Task 5: (optional) Update the custom map:
